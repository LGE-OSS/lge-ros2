# CLOiSim : Multi-Robot Simulator
It is a new multi-robot simulator that uses an SDF(www.sdformat.org) file containing 3d world environemnts and robot descriptions. The simulator is based on Unity 3D. It may look similar to Gazebo, where, unfortunately, we encountered performance problems while loading multiple robots equipped with multiple sensors.
